Fika is a Wayland-focused Rust file manager. The UI mainline is the default
`fika` binary, with a Fika-specific wgpu shell over a reusable native Wayland
runtime; the previous UI runtimes have been removed from the source tree.

> [中文版 / Chinese](README.zh-CN.md)

## Current Runtime

- `fika` is the default run target and the only in-tree file-manager UI.
- `wayland-client-runtime` is the reusable SCTK-based protocol, surface and
  event layer. Fika itself has no direct winit or SCTK dependency.
- `wgpu` comes from the official crates.io release.
- `fika-core` stays UI-neutral and owns filesystem/domain behavior.
- Clipboard and DnD use Wayland `wl_data_device`; rendering handles can be
  consumed by wgpu or direct Vulkan, and KDE blur keeps full region semantics.
- Parented dialogs, popup positioning/repositioning, cursor-shape fallback and
  drag icons are owned by the reusable Wayland layer.
- Local and inter-application drag-and-drop share the same Wayland
  source/offer, MIME-pipe and drop lifecycle after the local press threshold;
  scene state only owns the pre-protocol gesture, preview and target policy.
- Portal and privileged-helper binaries remain separate integration pieces.

## Build And Run

```bash
cargo run --bin fika -- --view compact /etc
cargo test --bin fika
scripts/check-rust-file-lines.sh
```

Every Rust source file has a strict 1000-line limit. The line gate has no legacy
exceptions and must pass before changes are merged.

Because `default-run` is `fika`, this also starts the current shell:

```bash
cargo run -- /etc
```

## Architecture Notes

- Pane state is routed by stable pane identity and stored through reusable pane
  containers, so split panes use the same state/projection/slot-pool path.
- Hot item views are retained and virtualized: visible-slot reuse, cached
  projection, cached text/icon atlas work, and explicit scroll metrics.
- The shell hot path uses MIME/icon role reuse by role + size, queued
  read-ahead, dirty-subrect atlas uploads, and tighter icon theme cache
  ownership.
- Core behavior follows Dolphin as the first reference for file-manager
  semantics, while the shell owns rendering, hit testing, DPI, input routing,
  overlays, and telemetry.
