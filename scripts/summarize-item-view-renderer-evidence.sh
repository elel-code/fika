Usage: summarize-item-view-renderer-evidence.sh LOG [LOG ...]

Runs the standard item-view runtime perf-log gate, then prints a Markdown
evidence block that can be copied into docs/ITEM_VIEW_RENDERER_DECISIONS.md.
This summarizes perf-log evidence only; manual DnD and rename smoke results must
still be recorded by a human reviewer.

Renderer decision follow-up:

- Compact/Icons base visuals: keep or revisit custom paint using static visual and custom paint maxima above.
- Compact/Icons image layer: keep or revisit custom paint using item image maxima, custom paint maxima, and the image_sources counters above.
- Details visual layer: keep or revisit custom paint using details visual and shape-cache channels above.
- Renderer surface counts: compare renderer_policy_frames against docs/ITEM_VIEW_RENDERER_DECISIONS.md.
- Retained hitbox drag start: keep gpui_drag_shell=0 and validate behavior with the DnD smoke checklist, not perf logs alone.
